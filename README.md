Country level - Disaster Management System

The Otto System have been inspired in the Otto Hurricane on november, 2016.

This natural fenomenon was a "first" in many aspects, as being the first one entering the north part on Costa Rica in the known history, and causing a big quantity of unexpected situations on the north and south part of the country.  Then, although the Emergency National corp attending natural disasters made a big effort to manage the situation, it is clear that Otto surpased the country organisations and the population custom on what to do on this level of emergency situations.

Independently of the pain, material and human losts (the exact number it is still unknown when writing this "Readme"), Otto provides with a very big live laboratory about what not to do and where to improve, when trying to confront country level natural disasters, that permits to create a better mechanism to manage similar future situations.


Observing the first logistic problems and the destruction level in the country, it is clear that centralised systems are not capable enough of controlling so disperse groups trying to help people in problems, neither TV, radio or even Cellular networks can provide with trustworthy comunication and management environments.  The only way to deal with this is through the use of distributed semi-autonomous systems that, being separated from the main information source, can still be used to understand and to resolve regional and/or local problems.

Then, an "Otto System", will be a prototypical placeholder to develop this type of emergency management systems.

It will provide of definitions, designs, and prototypes, that could be used as the base to create real emergency systems.  It is based on the MIT license pretending to be as open as possible, because not every country and organisation works the same way, and any solution must be appropriate to any real situation.  However, what be shared on this particular project always will be free and without any type of usage limitations, because a natural disaster go beyond what we, as individuals, can control.  We need to help everybody else.
