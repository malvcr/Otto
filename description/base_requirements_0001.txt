V1 (December 1, 2016)

According with the "evidence" material, an Otto System must accomplish these types
of requirements:


COMMUNICATIONS

- Must be multidirectional (authorities to citizen, and citizen to authorities).
- Must be distributed, where each "cell" must survive independently if all the other cells 
  fail, but where the surviving ones must actively "find the way" to communicate each with 
  the other.
- Any person must be able to report emergency and/or abnormal situations.

TRUST

- Each "participant" must have some type of signature being impossible to forfeit, and
  every piece of information must be signed.
- The information must include some "labeling" describing how trustworthy could be (it is
  a rumor to be verified, or is something that has been certified).
- Every action, and registration of information must produce an auditable track.
- Some information could be "private", but be able to be "released" by a superior
  authority with the corresponding advise to the information owner.
- Every communication and registration will be defined around special security protocols
  and practices.


DELEGATION

- Total control of delegated tasks.  The one delegates a task must receive a confirmation
  that the task has been performed, and that "delegation" can include a "quality check"
  provided by a different person than the one is confirming the task accomplishment. 
- The delegated tasks can have sub-delegated tasks, that will sum their "state" to the
  main levels, to have a "real" grade of accomplishment.
  
VOLUNTEERING and HUMAN RESOURCES

- The individuals must be able to report their capacity to perform different tasks, and
  how available are them.  For some tasks a confirmation must be included (by a third 
  party).
- A "voluntary guide" must be prepared to instruct the people what is the right method to
  offer help.  But this must be able to change according with the real situations.
- The people's capacity, together with what they can and "must" do, needs to be located on
  human resource's catalogs.  These catalogs must be shared between locations to improve
  their usage (and when somebody is performing some task, it must be registered there).

DONATIONS

- A "live" catalog must guide all possible type, quality and quantity of the donations.
- Each cataloged item must have a "minimum" quality level to be accepted and tabulated.
- There is an inventory based on the catalog.

DYNAMIC SHELTERS

- There is a set of official shelters, but also new places can be converted on shelters
  when necessary (in general each house "is" a shelter, the difference is that some people
  is not located in their own homes during the emergency period).
- Every shelter must be included as destination for items in the inventory.
- The shelters must be in pre and post emergency situation (the first one is preventive
  but the second one could be active more time if the people's houses can't be easily
  recovered).
- As the shelters are part of a "net", they must share their current capacity, state, 
  safety level, current usage and facilities, to improve the are usad (some overcrowded, 
  others empty ... some with paramedics, others with doctors ... some near where it is 
  possible to arrive walking, others far or after valleys, so helicopters must be used ...
  etc.).

DYNAMIC GEOGRAPHY

- According with the disaster type, it is possible that the geographical, safety and
  resource locations previously known can't be trusted anymore.  The system must be able
  to "mutate" to new conditions when enough information about them it is available.

TASKS

- Task templates according with particular possible situations must be created.
- Then, a catalog with possible situations must be related with those templates.
- When an emergency situation arises, real-time data must trigger these templates and
  how the situation evolves must be registered for (1) deciding on further actions and/or
  (2) dispatch automatic tasks (can be operational or informative).
  
- The situations catalog can't be static and must be updated with information about their 
  current state.  The information for that updating can have different sources, some with
  more or less trust grade, but all the information must be registered.  Some of these
  sources can be human, others could be sensors or even other systems with their
  calculations.

- Inhabitants must have early information about what to do in particular cases, and
  constantly updated information depending on how the related emergency situations 
  evolve (in some cases, the information must trigger SPEAKERS with audible noises or
  visible alarms whose meaning is already known by the inhabitants).
