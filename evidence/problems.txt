- Unidirectional communications by nature avoid important feedback
-- TV, Radio, SMS messages
-- Cellular phone towers "natural" failure had to be fixed (some of them flooded).
-- Phone emergency recharge stations provided, but what about people's phone accounts?  
   They will expire and people has no home to return to.
– Some “fake” and other “untrustworthy” emergency information making very complicated 
  to deal with the real situations.
 

- Organizational failure
-- Some work was delegated, but was not possible to guarantee how complaint the work 
   was performed
-- Early management advise but Late application in some areas.
-- Some people wanted to help but they were stopped because the corresponding information 
   about “how” to manage this type of help was not available (was not expected to receive 
   external help).
– Lack of education for the general population about “how” to help.  Some donations are 
  useless because of their nature and/or condition.
– Food has been collected but it was not being promptly delivered, in particular because 
  the quantity of refuge sites was not enough and was necessary to “improvise” new places 
  (authorities didn't know that people was located in these places).
– Was not possible to know how much people was located in each disaster place (rescue people 
  was very worried because they found empty houses destroyed and didn't know if somebody was 
  there).

- Geographical change
– The initial Hurricane overflow has been increased with regular rains.
– Rivers capacity is different.
– There are modifications about how the terrain is working (what is and what is not a safe 
  place to stay).  It is impossible to fix things the way they were before the hurricane arrived.

- Side effects
-- At least one shelter place had children with diarrhea (consequence of overcrowding) ... could 
   be possible to reorganize these places?
-- There is a generalized "terror" feeling about more problems because of the overflow rivers 
   and landslides.  There are many information sources and this confuses the people.

- Human Resources
-- There was a problen with a Vice-minister participating in a party while the Hurricane was 
   destroying Upala and the President was trying to coordinate the government work.  Independently 
   of the particular issue, the key here is that there is no centralized database with the people 
   experience and knowledge, what they could work on during this type of emergencies and what are 
   they doing in the emergency time.  And this human database doesn't need to be limited to government 
   officials, it can include the private sector also.

- External Factors
-- (without any type of confirmation), could be possible that more than the Hurricane was responsible 
   for the big flood in Upala zone.  In particular it seems that a DAM was opened approximately at the 
   same time the Zapote river was overflooding, so the water was moving counter current (an extremely 
   rare condition), causing unexpected side effects.  This produces some important points to take into 
   consideration:
--- Lack of list with tasks that must be observed for each type of situation (opening 
    a DAM "on the right time").  This includes a catalog for sensitive public or private activities.
--- Lack of confirmation that an important task was performed.
--- Lack of studies about consequences for regular tasks on abnormal situations (when not to do 
    something).
--- Lack of advice for inhabitants that could suffer consequences for some tasks.
--- When something "strange" happens, must be a way to collect all possible information about the 
    particular issue.
--- Lack of "sensors" that could trigger some type of alarm on dangerous places.

- Accounting
-- Deloitte will perform an auditing on the dissaster activities.  So, the data must be very well 
   tabulated.
