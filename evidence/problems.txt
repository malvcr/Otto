- Unidirectional communications by nature avoid important feedback
-- TV, Radio, SMS messages
-- Cellular phone towers "natural" failure had to be fixed (some of them flooded).
-- Phone emergency recharge stations provided, but what about people's phone accounts?  They will expire and people has no home to return to.
– Some “fake” and other “untrustworthy” emergency information making very complicated to deal with the real situations.
 

- Organizational failure
-- Some work was delegated, but was not possible to guarantee how complaint the work was performed
-- Early management advise but Late application in some areas.
-- Some people wanted to help but they were stopped because the corresponding information about “how” to manage this type of help was not available (was not expected to receive external help).
– Lack of education for the general population about “how” to help.  Some donations are useless because of their nature and/or condition.
– Food has been collected but it was not being promptly delivered, in particular because the quantity of refuge sites was not enough and was necessary to “improvise” new places (authorities didn't know that people was located in these places).
– Was not possible to know how much people was located in each disaster place (rescue people was very worried because they found empty houses destroyed and didn't know if somebody was there).

- Geographical change
– The initial Hurricane overflow has been increased with regular rains.
– Rivers capacity is different.
– There are modifications about how the terrain is working (what is and what is not a safe place to stay).  It is impossible to fix things the way they were before the hurricane arrived.

- Side effects
-- At least one shelter place had children with diarrhea (consequence of overcrowding) ... could be possible to reorganize these places?
-- There is a generalized "terror" feeling about more problems because of the overflow rivers and landslides.  There are many information sources and this confuses the people.
