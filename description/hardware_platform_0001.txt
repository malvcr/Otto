WIFI Network

- The first option is to assemble a distributed WIFI network around the central
  population centers.
- This is NOT a public network, but an emergency network opened to public emergency
  nodes.  It is important to make this differentiation to separate other non 
  important usages and external "destructive hacking".
- WIFI, as a protocol is not powerful enough to cover very big areas, so the NODES
  must be capable to act as range extensors, and it is important to have good 
  quality antenas and powerful WIFI adapters, in particular when they are on open
  areas.
   
WHY NOT INTERNET

- The Internet is a very helpful resource when it works, but in many places it
  depends on service providers (i.e. centralized infrastructure).
- In this case, the infrastructure must be bullet-proof, so it is not possible to have
  a dependency on central data axis points.  It must 100% distributed where each "zone"
  must survive by itself.
  
WHAT TO DO ON INTERNET

- When the Internet is available, the security nodes can work as data clusters that can
  share information on very long distances immediately.  However, enough routing 
  capacity must be present to offer the same functionality without the Internet.

SMALL SBC (Single Board Computers)

- They must be energy efficient, so PCs are discarded.
- They must be small.
- They must be cheap enough to guarantee distribution and replacement when necessary
  (to replace them must be cheaper than to fix them, and less than $100).
  
OPERATING SYSTEM

- Highly available for several SBC machines (no mather what CPU the use).
- Zero cost
- It seems Linux is the only option

DATABASE

- Could be a custom open source database if necessary.
- As the NODES will be distributed, it must be maintenance-free.
- Needs to be replicated for the data to survive critical failures.
