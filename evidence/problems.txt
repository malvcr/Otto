COMMUNICATIONS

- Unidirectional communications by nature avoid important feedback
-- TV, Radio, SMS

- Cellular phone towers "natural" failure had to be fixed (some of them flooded).
- Phone emergency recharge stations provided, but what about people's phone accounts?  
  They will expire and people has no home to return to.
- Some “fake” and other "untrustworthy" emergency information making very complicated 
  to deal with the real situations.
 

ORGANIZATIONAL FAILURE

- Some work was delegated, but was not possible to guarantee how complaint the work 
  was performed
- Early management advise but Late application in some areas.
- Some people wanted to help but they were stopped because the corresponding information 
  about "how" to manage this type of help was not available (was not expected to receive 
  external help).
- Lack of education for the general population about "how" to help.  Some donations are 
  useless because of their nature and/or condition.
- Food has been collected but it was not being promptly delivered, in particular because 
  the quantity of refuge sites was not enough and was necessary to "improvise" new places 
  (authorities didn't know that people was located in these places).
- Was not possible to know how much people was located in each disaster place (rescue 
  people was very worried because they found empty houses destroyed and didn't know if
  somebody was there).

GEOGRAPHICAL CHANGE

- The initial hurricane overflow has been increased with regular rains.
- Rivers capacity is different.
- There are modifications about how the terrain is working (what is and what is not a
  safe place to stay).  It is impossible to fix things the way they were before the
  hurricane arrived.

SIDE EFFECTS

- At least one shelter place had children with diarrhea (consequence of overcrowding) ... 
  could be possible to reorganize these places?
- There is a generalized "terror" feeling about more problems because of the overflow 
  rivers and landslides.  There are many information sources and this confuses the 
  people.

HUMAN RESOURCES

- There was a problem with a Vice-minister participating in a party while the Hurricane 
  was destroying Upala and the President was trying to coordinate the government work.    
  Independently of the particular issue, the key here is that there is no centralized 
  database with the people experience and knowledge, what they could work on during this 
  type of emergencies and what are they doing in the emergency time.  And this human 
  database doesn't need to be limited to government officials, it can include the private 
  sector also.

EXTERNAL FACTORS

- (Because a rumor - without any type of confirmation), could be possible that more than
  the Hurricane was responsible for the big flood in Upala zone.  In particular it seems 
  that a DAM was opened approximately at the same time the Zapote river was overflooding, 
  so the water was moving counter current (an extremely rare condition), causing 
  unexpected side effects.  This produces some important points to take into 
  consideration:
-- Lack of list with tasks that must be observed for each type of situation (opening 
   a DAM "in the right time").  This includes a catalog for sensitive public or private 
   activities.
-- Lack of confirmation that an important task was performed.
-- Lack of studies about consequences for regular tasks on abnormal situations (when not 
   to do something).
-- Lack of advice for inhabitants that could suffer consequences for some tasks.
-- When something "strange" happens, must be a way to collect all possible information 
   about the particular issue.
-- Lack of "sensors" that could trigger some type of alarm on dangerous places.

ACCOUNTING

- Deloitte will perform an auditing on the disaster activities.  So, the data must be very 
  well tabulated.
